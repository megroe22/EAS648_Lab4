This is why cities tend to have warmer temperatures compared to rural areas due to developed infrastructure and lack of green spaces or tree cover. The infrastructure tends to absorb and retain more heat, leading to higher temperatures. This is why tree coverage is vital in sheltering communities from heat waves and helps to reduce heat-related illnesses and mortality. Urban trees also help to reduce erosion and filter rainwater. Their root systems work to keep the ground drier, which can also help to reduce flooding. These are just a few of the reasons why urban tree cover is so important."

I made a video a while ago about the growing wealth inequality in America and this guy came on the video and said nobody owes you anything. So I made a response asking him what the point of family and community and government and all the other structures that humans have made around ourselves And he said something about how families and governments owe you something, but corporations don't owe you anything. And he's right and he's wrong, because corporations are a made-up idea, and they owe you exactly what we say they owe you. When you do something like repeal Chevron and hobble every regulatory agency in the country, the decision of what a corporation owes to us gets left up to the corporation. And it's gonna make that decision I was talking about at the beginning of the video. I've been thinking about the comment this guy left a lot, this comment that corporations don't owe us anything, and I have to ask, If a corporation doesn't owe us anything, why would we keep them around? And especially why would we keep them around if what is in the best interest of most humans is often directly opposed to what is in the best interest of the corporation, which is almost always maximizing profits? We don't even tolerate other humans in our communities who show blatant disregard for our well-being and safety. Why would we tolerate that from an entirely made-up legal entity? Why would we make that up to begin with? What kind of insane human society would position all their power and wealth Did you guys know that we have these things called right to farm laws and functionally what they're supposed to do is protect small farmers from nuisance lawsuits. If you're a city slicker and you move into an agricultural area, you're not supposed to be able to sue the farmer next door because you don't like his pigs. But overwhelmingly, what those laws have ended up doing is benefiting CAFOs or factory farms. And in fact, small farmers often lose litigation against CAFOs because of right-to-farm laws. And even if they don't lose against them that directly, small farmers are often driven out of their small farms because CAFOs are protected by things like right-to-farm laws and can do just extraordinary nonsense. The same kind of idea, that farmers deserve special protection, largely exempts the agriculture industry from the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. The idea that we need to protect small farmers has also historically hobbled the EPA and made it nearly impossible for the EPA to do anything about regulating the agricultural industry. But again, it is overwhelmingly not small farmers who benefit from this lack of regulation. This lack of regulation allows factory farms to ignore the needs and well-being of humans it is existing in community with. Factory farms are linked to poverty, loss of family farms, and poor health outcomes in rural areas. They increase the taxpayer's burden to clean municipal water, restore eroded land, and address air pollution. They damage natural ecosystems. They destroy wildlife habitats. They encourage antibiotic resistance and superbugs. They erode animal welfare, encourage land degradation, and contribute to deforestation. They're important emitters of greenhouse gases and directly contribute to climate change. All of this because agricultural exceptionalism and the idea that we have to protect farmers at all costs has actually benefited large corporations. And it has hobbled the EPA for decades. Revoking power from regulatory bodies by repealing Chevron is going to replicate this in every sector. To give corporations unfettered control over our society is madness because they are not humans and they do not care about humans."

But there's a darker side to this green giant. Beneath the boxy design of the Cybertruck and that self-driving AI that might unalive you, Tesla's financial strategy actually relies heavily on carbon credits, a practice that raises serious ethical concerns. In 2023, Tesla earned a whopping $1.79 billion from selling carbon credits. Since 2009, Tesla has earned over $7 billion. Since 2009, this revenue stream has netted Tesla over $9 billion, making it a cornerstone of the company's profitability. Carbon credits are essentially permits that allow companies to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide. Companies that produce fewer emissions can sell their extra credit to those that have exceeded their limits. Tesla, with its zero emission vehicles, generates a lot of these credits and sells them to traditional automakers who need to meet regulatory requirements. But here's the catch. By selling these carbon credits, Tesla is effectively allowing other companies to continue polluting. Instead of reducing their own emissions, these companies just buy their way out of trouble, undermining the overall goal of reducing that carbon footprint. In an interview with Dr. Emily Clark, an environmental policy expert, she explains Tesla's significant revenue from carbon credits highlights a problematic reliance on these markets. While Tesla's cars are indeed less polluting, the sale of carbon credits to less green automakers allows those companies to delay making their own necessary changes for the environment. Tesla's ability to generate and sell carbon credits has turned it into a financial juggernaut, but the strategy is a double-edged sword. Other automakers buy these credits instead of investing themselves in sustainable practices, perpetuating a cycle of dependency on outdated, polluting practices. This practice of selling indulgences in the form of carbon credits allows Tesla to profit while contributing to a system that does little to combat the current issues of climate change. While Tesla enjoys its green reputation and financial success, the true cost is borne by the environment. Carbon credits provide a convenient smokescreen, allowing businesses to claim green credentials without making any meaningful changes. Supporting the mission of saving our planet is important, but we need to demand transparency and real action from these companies. True sustainability requires more than just buying and selling these carbon credits. It demands genuine, actionable reductions in emissions because the future of our planet absolutely depends on it.

So the same thing that's going to fix the soils is the same thing that's going to draw down enough CO2 out of the atmosphere to help slow down climate change. These cows are that thing. Firstly, cows are not a thing. They're a living creature that are capable of suffering. Focusing just on carbon and not looking at the long-term impacts for methane or even looking at the impacts at all for nitrous oxide, which is also a part of animal agriculture emissions, is really convenient for regenerative animal farmers. This is also conveniently overlooking the land use issue with regenerative animal farming and grazing. Because in order to meet current demand for animal flesh, especially cow flesh, we would have to drastically increase our land use. That's just not sustainable and it's not a solution to the climate issue. I want to talk about solutions to the climate issue. The solutions are planting trees and investing in a plant-based food system that is actually sequestering carbon in the soil and not relying on unsustainable practices of raising animals at a loss of energy just to consume the animals."

Climate tech is what we call technological solutions for climate change, whether it be technologies that are enabling the adoption of electric trucks, like what I do, or battery technologies that allow us to move away from fossil fuels. Climate technologies can fall into the following categories. First is technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Second is technologies that remove carbon from the air or land. And third is technologies that can help our communities build resilience to the effects of climate change. And let me know if you want me to go more in depth into each of these categories.

Because places are flooded and homeowners insurance has moved out or wherever in Florida.

It cannot be that I'm gonna have to spend more of my tax dollars because Greg Abbott had to take a trip to Korea and not at all manage the state that he refused to weatherize. That's ridiculous.

Scientists from the NIAS Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research have just dropped a bombshell in the journal Nature Communications. By analyzing sediment from the Pacific Ocean, they uncovered that doubling atmospheric CO2 levels could spike our planet's average temperature by a staggering 13 to 25.2 degrees Fahrenheit. This is far beyond the 4.1 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit previously estimated by the UN Climate Panel. The implications? Our CO2 emissions are cooking the planet faster and harder than we thought. Global overheating is not just a theory. It's melting glaciers, flooding coastal communities, intensifying extreme weather, spreading diseases, making crops fail, and causing heat-related deaths.

We don't produce enough food waste to feed it ourselves. Once a week I bike down to the local fruit and veggie market, hop into their bin and take about 10 kilograms of food. Biogas is produced when organic matter biodegrades in the absence of oxygen and when it does that it produces a mixture of gases which can be used to provide a number of energy services from cooking to heating space to lighting and heating water."

https://www.tiktok.com/@chelsycuriositycorner/video/7379758309911399722,"Welcome back to my Curiosity Corner. Today we're going to be talking about the Climate Solutions series that you can find on my page. So within this series, as you can see, there are nine different 5E lessons that are all related to a solution that's proposed in the Project Drawdown Climate Solutions Library. In one of the Climate in the Classroom videos, there is a little bit of information about the Project Drawdown Solutions Library because one of the activities requires that students use this. But I have made nine separate lessons that are going to catalog the top nine climate solutions proposed by Project Drawdown. And what do I mean by top nine? Well, in the scenarios that they have, that's gigatons of CO2 that could be removed by this particular solution. And so I decided to choose the top 10 right here. As you can see, these are all gonna be listed as one of the topics for my 5E lessons. The only one that I haven't gotten to yet is utility-scale solar photovoltaics, but there is a lesson on distributed solar photovoltaics at the moment, and so you can at least touch on solar panels in your class through that. Just like in the lessons for climate in the classroom, these lessons are just meant to show students that there are many proposed solutions out there, and we're going to have to do a very large mix of different climate solutions in order to start seeing those atmospheric greenhouse gases truly go down. And then of course, start to solve climate change. So for this video, I'm not going to go into too many specifics, but I just want to highlight some features of the lessons. Like I said, they're all going to be 5E model lessons. If you don't know about that, I am going to make a video very soon about what the 5E model is in science. But for example, a lot of them are going to have some interactive graphs like this one. There are also handouts for every lesson, so you don't have to create anything from scratch. Everything is provided to you. In this particular one, students are building a windmill or a wind turbine, so of course you are gonna have to buy some materials, but not all of them require you to buy anything. There's really simple handouts like this one that you can use generically in really any type of data analysis, but these are just available to you, created by me on Canva, my favorite, and you're able to download them and use them for whatever you'd like. Another feature is some real world scenarios. So this is in one of the activities here. In another lesson, students are writing a letter. So this is kind of bringing in policy into the conversation. All that to say that the project drawdown library is really important for getting the conversation about climate solutions going. And the climate in the classroom toolkit is amazing, but this is just a really huge array of different ways in which we can start to think about climate solutions. And I've made a lesson for each of them. So you can use all of them depending on your class, or you can use one of them. They're all going to be addressing the same NGSS standard. And that standard, I'm going to read it word for word here, is HSEss34, which is to evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems. So that's exactly what all of these solutions are. And I just chose the top nine for most impactful when it comes to Project Drawdown. So I hope you love it and please like and share this video if you want to see specifics on every single one of the lessons. I'd love to make that series for y'all."

This cataclysmic eruption released an estimated 100 cubic kilometers of ash and debris, launching it high into the atmosphere and altering global weather patterns. The immediate aftermath saw the local area devastated, with tens of thousands of lives lost due to pyroclastic flows and volcanic ash. But the effects of Tambora reached far beyond its immediate vicinity. In 1816, known as the year without a summer, the eruption caused widespread agricultural failures across the northern hemisphere. Europe and North America experienced devastating cold, leading to famine and social unrest. Crops failed and food prices skyrocketed, prompting mass migrations and contributing to social upheaval. The dimming of sunlight due to ash particles in the atmosphere resulted in eerie, gloomy days and spectacular sunsets. Artists and writers of the time captured this surreal landscape, influencing works like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Tambora's eruption serves as a stark reminder of nature's power and its profound impact on human history, shaping economies, societies, and cultural narratives for generations."

This revolutionary idea opens a Pandora's box of possibilities in conservation and ecological restoration. Imagine recreating lush prehistoric forests or vibrant coral reefs that once thrived before human interference. The implications for biodiversity are staggering. First, cloning ecosystems could restore balance to our current habitats by reintroducing lost species and functions. For instance, recreating a woolly mammoth ecosystem might help regenerate the tundra, countering climate change. However, it's not just about cloning, it's about understanding the intricate relationships within these ecosystems. Would cloned ecosystems behave like their ancient counterparts? Or would they adapt to modern conditions? Moreover, ethical concerns arise. Should we focus on revitalizing extinct systems? Or should we prioritize safeguarding existing ones? The challenges of cloning ecosystems include ensuring genetic diversity and preventing the spread of invasive species. Scientists would need advanced tools in genetics and ecology to achieve this. In short, the ability to clone extinct ecosystems could redefine our approach to nature and conservation, but it comes with immense responsibility and complex ethical dilemmas to navigate."

Innovative technologies like carbon capture and storage could play a vital role, pulling CO2 from the atmosphere and sequestering it safely underground. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar and hydro could replace fossil fuels entirely, leading to cleaner air and healthier communities. Furthermore, reforestation and afforestation efforts could enhance biodiversity, creating habitats for countless species and improving our planet's resilience. The agricultural sector would also undergo a transformation, embracing regenerative practices that enrich soil health and increase crop yields without harming the environment.

They're based on the predictions of climate scientists, the very same climate scientists who decades ago were predicting what we are seeing today with hurricanes Helene and Milton. The global temperature will continue to rise. Even if we did everything we could, it would still go up, but it would slow down and eventually stop, eventually reverse. The higher up it goes, the more catastrophic the effects of climate change will be. As polar ice caps melt and ice shelves collapse, we will see massive rises in sea level. Events like hurricanes might not become more common per se, but they will become more severe. They will dump more water. Certain regions of the globe will experience catastrophic flooding. Entire communities may be wiped out by this. While some places will be dealing with too much rain, others will be dealing with drought, which will cause starvation. And as global temperatures continue to rise, certain locations will experience temperatures that human life cannot endure. Places like Bangladesh have been flirting with this for some time. When this happens, over a sustained period of time, there will be millions of deaths within a short amount of time. The United States may be less vulnerable to this, but it is not invulnerable. Communities like Houston, for example, would be in the crosshairs of these sorts of effects. There will be massive amounts of migration. There will be climate refugees. If you think the refugee crises we have today are large, these will dwarf them by orders of magnitude. And people will continue to deny climate change, at least human-caused climate change, is happening. If this video gets out of the 200-300 club, you'll see it in my comments."

And I know it's a big joke. Everybody's laughing about it, about how it's so cold in their region and they're not used to it. And I read the comments and people are saying, yeah, we don't even own coats and all that. Ha ha ha ha ha. But this is climate change. It's not weather. Weather happens on a daily basis. Climate change takes place over a long period of time. That hurricane that we've seen that went towards Mexico and they made that big curve and went back and hit South Carolina and did all that flooding up on the mountainous east coast, that's climate change. All these tornadoes that we're seeing that are so destructive, category fives and things, that's climate change. These atmospheric rivers, I'm sure you've heard about those. That's climate change. These wildfires, climate change. One of the things that a lot of people don't understand, and I'm gonna explain it to you. We always hear about carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide, CO2, people talk about CO2. But what you don't understand is, it's not that CO2 is so dangerous, because people always make this joke, well, CO2, it's for the plants, it makes everything green and all this. Yeah, that's true. And one of the things I think is funny is people say, well, 5 million, 10 million years ago, CO2 levels were so high on this planet. Yeah, you know something else? Humans weren't around then. We weren't around when CO2 levels were that high. Humans have only been around for around 5 to 600,000 years. We haven't been around for millions of years. So when CO2 was really, really high, there were no humans. But let me get back to what I was saying. What you don't understand is, It's not that the CO2 is so dangerous, but what the CO2 does is it warms the atmosphere. Number one, it allows more water vapor because the water evaporates. So then you have CO2 and then you have water vapor. So that's why you get these atmospheric rivers and these hurricanes able to hold so much water because there's more water vapor. But what's the most dangerous thing is this CO2 and this water vapor up in the sky warms the earth so much that you get The ice up in the north. The permafrost melting. And as the permafrost melts, it releases methane. And methane is hundreds of times more strong than CO2. And methane is what's dangerous. Go on to YouTube and type in North Methane fire or whatever and you'll see people out in the snow light fire and poof or you'll see lakes or rivers bubbling that's the methane escaping and that methane is escaping because of the co2 and the water vapor that's warming the atmosphere causing all that permafrost to melt and there's trillions of tons of organisms, leaves, things like that that have been buried and died and rotted. And if something rots, it releases methane gas. Methane is way more dangerous. And I'm going to tell you one more thing that blows your mind. Do you know that it takes about 20 to 25 years for the atmosphere to build up enough CO2 that you actually start to notice changes? So the year is 2025 almost. We're like less than a month away. The heating and the problems that we're seeing today is caused from CO2 that was released in the year 2000. So think about that. We're in the year 2025 and all these issues that we're having now is because of all the CO2 released in the year 2000, 25 years ago. Imagine what it's going to be like in 2025 with all of this drilling and all of this industrial growth and all of these cars still releasing CO2, still releasing, allowing the water vapor to go up into the sky, causing the permafrost to melt and all the methane go up. This is climate change. Weather happens on it daily. Climate change happens over decades, centuries. You may think it's funny, but someday, oh, wait, before I say that, let me run one more little thing past you. When you see people post, one of my favorite posts I love to see is people who post a picture of Plymouth Rock. And they'll show it with the waters going over it. And they'll say, see guys, see, Plymouth Rock, it's at sea level, blah, blah, blah. It should be covered by water. And they're such idiots. Number one, Plymouth Rock, the actual rock that was down by the water, was actually moved. It's in a different location now. And they built this big structure around it. I've been there. It's pretty cool. High Tide and Low Tide"

The analysis also reveals that climate change has intensified the heat, providing no nighttime relief. From June 2 to 6, the nighttime temperature in Corpus Christi, Texas, never dropped below 80 degrees. The report connects the extreme heat to at least 125 deaths in Mexico. Researchers emphasize that what's most alarming is that such heat waves are no longer unusual."
https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.matthewwielicki/video/7335904699880607018,"Hey, tick-tock, Dr. Matthew Wyalicki here. Haven't made a video in a while, but I've had a whole bunch of people asking me about my feelings or response to the trial that recently was concluded with Dr. Michael Mann and Ran Simberg and Mark Stein. If you're not aware of this, about 12 years ago, Penalty 2 Pen State Football Program and so uh michael dr michael mann sued for defamation 12 years ago um dragged out the case for a really long time for 12 years and recently won his case he was awarded um he the the both of the defendants were were uh were guilty and um they were guilty of defamation with malice meaning that they Penalties are $1 each Losses that were incurred in terms of damages that Dr. Michael Mann suffered due to his reputation, meaning he didn't suffer anything. This was a blog post that very few people read. In fact, it's much more famous now than it ever was because of this trial. Not a lot of people would have read it. And then, in punitive damages, Ranzenberg was ordered to pay $1,000, but Mark Stein was ordered to pay $1,000,000 in punitive damages to Dr. Michael Mann. And this is essentially a message, right? They're trying to send a message. The prosecution was very clearly trying to show that this isn't Dr. Michael Mann that's on trial, this is climate science that's on trial. And one thing that came out of this trial was very clearly what a despicable human being Dr. Michael Mann is and how awful he is to his colleagues and to those that don't agree with him. He's called me out on social media a whole bunch of times and then blocked me, like the coward that he is. But it's clear that this was a message. This is a message to the public that when we say follow the science not only do we mean it but now we mean it in a legal sense because if you don't follow the science if you critique the science if you have any sort of criticism to to make about the science now the precedent is is that the scientists will sue you and it's all over social media scientists Applauding this verdict and talking about how they're going to start suing folks for going after or for being critical of their research. One great example that really kind of puts this all into a real clear mode is the recent freak out about the Atlantic Multidecadal circulation, the AMOC, the Atlantic Multidecadal overturned circulation. um this is the circulation that takes warm water from the equator brings it along the eastern seaboard of the united states and then up into the north atlantic and it really regulates the temperatures of the northern hemisphere particularly places like europe where these warm waters kind of create a temperate climate that otherwise would have been could be much colder if you weren't getting these warm waters going up there And so recently, some Dutch scientists came out with a report that said that this is on a tipping point, that this is about to collapse. The AMOC is going to collapse soon. And if it does, Northern Europe and the whole Northern Hemisphere is going to have dramatic climate changes on the order of three to five degrees Celsius of cooling very rapidly. And this could be devastating in terms of agriculture and economy and you name it. And so this was picked up by all the mainstream media and of course by all of the climate alarmists and retweeted and posted all over the mainstream media. And it was very quickly identified that these researchers had essentially forced their model. They took completely unrealistic assumptions about the amount of freshwater input into the Northern Atlantic And they essentially forced their model to give an outcome that is completely unreasonable. And then they not only published that through the peer review process, but they had all of these famous climate scientists and large media publications applauding them and talking about their research and how amazing this new result is and how this just proves that climate change is real and is an existential threat and we need to respond right away. But if you force a model to give you a result that you want, that's not how science is done. That's not science at all. In fact, my PhD advisor who really nailed this home to me, a famous statistician by the name of George Box said this, All models are wrong, but some are useful. And that's really important. Models are useful, and they absolutely are, but models are completely an unrealistic replication of a natural system. We don't understand all of the forcing that occurs in a natural system, so we oversimplify models, and then we force them and tweak them by the assumptions and by the inputs that we put in to give us the result that we want. Garbage in, garbage out. This is exactly how this whole climate alarmism is done. But now if you critique these, are these British scientists who critiqued this new result and showed that this is essentially a BS result that is forced through completely unrealistic assumptions, are they gonna face lawsuits now? Is this the new way that we debate science in the public realm? Is we sue each other for millions of dollars? It's absolutely ridiculous. Michael Mann showed that he's a despicable human being and a terrible scientist and a terrible scientific colleague. And that I'm grateful for because that really exposed him. But the outcome of the trial is absolutely detrimental to sharing public, to scientists being critical of each other, to the public getting the accurate scientific information and not some manipulated version Because they're trying to change policy or to change behavior. We saw it with COVID. We're seeing it with climate. This is the new realm that we're in and the public really needs to fight back. Support independent journalists. Support independent researchers. Ignore mainstream media. I've got a sub stack irrationalfear.com. Check it out. I talk a lot about science and peer review and the damage that the scientific community is doing to scientific integrity, particularly in climate science and in COVID. So check that out, irrationalfear.com. That's my sub stack and thanks for the support. Have a great day."

You could really tell there's still plenty of zooxanthellae on that reef! What? It's algae that lives in the coral and gives them those bright colors. Actually, no. When coral gets stressed from climate change, like warming oceans or pollution, they boot out the algae to protect themselves and then lose their color. That's happening all over the world. So stressed out coral with love bleached kind of like coral skeletons. So they die? Not always but without algae they get weaker and more prone to disease and if they can't recover then they die. This is the most depressing snorkel ever. Don't forget living reefs are also really important ecosystems. They house like a quarter of ocean species, they protect coastlines, but they're dying from hot polluted oceans and also from ocean acidification. I can't. Okay, what's that? When oceans work overtime to absorb our extra carbon dioxide, they become more acidic, and that makes it harder for coral to build and keep their skeletons. So, besides trying to keep the planet from warming, what can people do to, you know, lower coral stress levels? Avoid using chemicals like lawn fertilizers and pesticides that run off into storm drain. Oh, I don't use those. Beach cleanups. Oh, and we didn't even talk about how industrial overfishing kills coral reefs. So looking for sustainably fished seafood, if that's an option. But coral can recover. I want to go look at those colors again."
https://www.tiktok.com/@drilledmedia/video/7389711096304717102,"Okay, I'm just making my way through chapter 13 of the Project 2025 book, which is the plan for the Environmental Protection Agency. And honestly, I've gotten to page two and I have so many thoughts, so this is probably gonna take a while. First, a key thing to point out. The author of this chapter, oh my god, Mandy. I have so many thoughts. So Mandy started out as the young Senator Einhofe aide who brought him a snowball on the floor of the Senate for him to make the point that because it still snows sometimes, climate change can't possibly be happening. She went on from there to work for a group called the CO2 Coalition, which has promoted amongst various other theories, the idea that more CO2 is actually a good thing for the atmosphere because it will encourage more plants to grow. That's technically true in some parts of the world, but it will also destroy crops and lots of other parts of the world. And they don't like to talk about that part. She was also chief of staff for the Trump EPA. So I imagine that's why she's been tasked with writing this chapter. She's testified at a bunch of different hearings. Like she's been the Republican witness for a lot of the climate disinformation hearings. They often ask her to do that kind of stuff. Today, she runs something called like the Center for Energy or like Center for Energy and Environment or something like that for a group called the Independent Women's Forum. That's another one of these groups similar to Heritage where they get funding from the whole universe. Searle is very involved with them. Bradley Foundation funds them, Donors Trust, Cokes, they all fund the International Women's Foundation and the whole point of that thing is basically like organizational version of Phyllis Schlafly. So like they need women promoting conservative ideas too so that they don't seem sexist or misogynistic. A key thing to know also about Mandy is that she has absolutely no background in environmental science of any kind. I think she was like a poli-sci major who then went on to get a law degree. from the University of Mississippi, Missouri, one of those states, and doesn't know anything about environmental science or climate science or any of those things. She is a lawyer and a political operator, not someone that should be in charge of how we deal with environmental regulation, probably. Okay, second thing that caught my attention is this reference to true transparency. Um, if you have not been a longtime EPA watcher, you might not know that that reference is a very specific policy that the, uh, the right tried to get passed during the Trump administration and just failed kind of by the skin of its teeth, barely failed to make it. But they've said that they would reintroduce it in a new Trump administration. This is a policy that was crafted by long time climate denier Steve Malloy. He worked as a tobacco lobbyist for a long time and then started working for Peabody Coal and lots of other coal companies and has been Anti-climate Secret Science Proposal All of the demographic information, all of this stuff. And there was some talk about some of that being anonymized, but there are a lot of issues there around how researchers would be able to do that without running afoul of HIPAA laws. So if you're doing tests on Air pollution impacts on human health. You need to do some amount of human health studies, ideally with real people. And a lot of that is done via longitudinal studies. So they'll go to a certain group of people over several years and they'll measure exposure and then health impacts and all that kind of thing. Malloy has been a huge critic of that research in particular for a long time, the air pollution research, because who did he work for? Tobacco and coal. What did tobacco and coal hate? Air pollution regulations. So he's been like the guy fighting to roll back air pollution regulations. And a big part of how he has tried to do that is to use this one woman's case in particular Who was part of a study who tragically ended up dying and it may well have been that the researchers were responsible for that or there was some problem in how the research was conducted and I completely think we should address those kinds of things. However, I don't think that he's really Using that example in good faith. He's on the payroll of various industries that have a huge interest in rolling back air pollution regulations, which would be a big problem because air pollution still kills millions of people. I've interviewed Malloy in the past and he has said things to the effect of like, our air is already clean enough. We don't need any more. Air pollution regulations. He has said to me on more than one occasion on the record that his goal and the goal of his colleagues is actually to get rid of the EPA, which was pretty clear with the Trump transition team the first time around. Anyway, the idea of the secret science proposal is that, you know, everything needs to be out in the open. And then if you cannot meet that threshold, which a lot of the researchers who are using human subjects wouldn't be able to be because they would be legally bound to not disclose certain things, then your research is considered like less valuable. So they would wait different studies according to whether they could meet certain criteria and then the agency should be like not basing regulations on the lower weighted studies. So, does that serve public health or the environment? No, it serves corporations. Again, that is the entire goal of all of this stuff. It's like, what can best protect corporations from regulation? Their definition of freedom, if you actually read the policy proposals, Expanded corporate rights, expanded corporate freedom at the expense of individual freedom and the protection of the public. Then we got to this overview section where she's talking about how problematic it is that the Biden administration has, quote, reinstituted unachievable standards designed to aid in the quote-unquote transition away from politically disfavored industries and technologies and toward the Biden administration's preferred alternatives. I have a lot to say about this, starting with, I wish, I wish the Biden administration was actually using the EPA to support an actual transition away from fossil fuels. What is happening in lieu of that is a whole lot of support for quote unquote solutions that the industry has proposed and that actually keep it afloat for a lot longer, carbon capture being chief among them. The entire carbon capture industry has been created by federal subsidy as a way to keep the oil and gas industry afloat, paid for by taxpayers. That is like the upshot of that entire effort. It's honestly like so mind blowing to me that we have an entire new tax credit worth tens of billions of dollars for this industry, no measurable benefit to the public, no auditable impact on climate emissions, nothing. It's just a giveaway of money. And yet, because they use the industry's wording on it as a climate solution, it's also fodder for the right to argue against environmental regulation."
https://www.tiktok.com/@drrhondamj/video/7390591159338388766,"Hello, I'm Dr. Rhonda Johnson. Today is Thursday, July 11, 2025. Today, I'm discussing Project 2025 and the proposals on climate change. Now, the World Health Organization knows that climate change is directly contributing to humanitarian crises, from heat waves to wildfires to storms, hurricanes, floods. And they are increasing in scale, frequency, and intensity. Their research shows that 3.6 billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change, and between 2030, which is five years from now, and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year. So, folks, by now, if you live in the United States, you've probably heard of Project 2025. It's the ultraconservative agenda that if a Republican nominee wins the 2024 presidential election, this will go into effect. Now, yesterday, I shared some of Project 2025 proposals to reform the federal health care agenda. Today I'm discussing climate change because climate change directly affects our health. So Project 2025 proposes comprehensive rollbacks of climate change policies and programs Enacted under President Biden's administration, key elements of this plan include prioritizing fossil fuel production and minimizing the regulatory power of federal agencies like the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. Now, here are some verbatim quotes from the document. On page 378, it says, in the focus, on climate change and green subsidies. Page 386. Eliminate the Clean Energy Corps by revoking funding and eliminating all positions and personnel hired under the program. Page 408. Should not use environmental issues like climate change as a reason to stop liquid natural gas projects. Page 508. repeal climate change initiatives and spending in the Department of Housing and Urban Development budgets requests. Page 709, the next administration should eliminate the Climate Hub Office and withdraw from climate change agreements that are inimical to the prosperity of the United States and withdraw the U.S. from the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Now, those were the verbatims. Now, to summarize other key climate-related proposals in Project 2025. They involve increasing fossil fuel production. They want to expand oil and gas leasing on public lands and waters, including high-profile projects like the Willow Oil Drilling Project in Alaska. They also seek to expedite federal drilling permits and fracked gas pipeline approvals. They recommend eliminating various clean energy programs and offices within the Department of Energy, such as the Office of Clean Energy and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Project 2025 targets the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides significant funding for clean energy initiatives. Project 2025 wants to downsize the EPA. Freezing Existing Regulations and Cutting the Agency's Funding. Now, there's a lot more in that document, which basically shuts down federal current and future climate change action efforts. And I hope you'll read this document. Now, yesterday I talked about Project 2025 and healthcare. You know, our health is deeply intertwined With climate change. So I hope that you will share this document, share this video and share the videos that I did yesterday. And please comment if you have any concerns. That's my message today. As always, take care and be well."

Since 1950, all the plastic we produced on Earth has ultimately ended up in the ocean, where there is now between 75 to 200 million tons of it. The area of plastic islands on the ocean surface is equal to the territory of the United States and Australia, but this is only 1% of the plastic. Meanwhile, 99% of the plastic in the form of nanoplastic is practically in every molecule of ocean water throughout its entire depth, significantly disrupting the ocean's thermal conductivity. Evidence of the irreversibility of the ocean's demise is the final death of coral reefs. vast underwater organisms that existed for hundreds of thousands of years. Today, the ocean is warming at an unprecedented rate. Shocking scientific data on ocean temperatures in 2023 and 2024 have exceeded all existing predictive models, except for ours. And there are no indications whatsoever that this process will reverse itself. Thus, due to anthropogenic influence, the ocean no longer performs its thermal conductivity function, and heat remains trapped in its depths, increasing magma activity across the entire planet. These devastating conditions create the prerequisites for a global, planet-wide catastrophe. which the Earth has not yet witnessed, but of which we, modern humanity, are likely to become witnesses to. The urgency of altering policies and rhetoric on climate and geodynamic changes on Earth is paramount, as the threatening processes are accelerating at a swift pace. Compare the condition of the ocean a decade ago, two years ago, a year ago, and now, in 2024, and contemplate how much time remains for humankind. We squander debating the cause of climate change. Rather than disputing the matter, we ought to be collaborating and seek a resolution. In the end, the responsibility rests solely with humans."

This compared to 13% from every form of transportation on the planet combined. Animal agribusiness also both uses and pollutes almost half of the Earth's available land, and is responsible for over 90% of Amazon rainforest losses. Further, it is the greatest contributor to wildlife habitat destruction, and it is easily the leading cause of species extinction and ocean dead zones. Finally, while fracking consumes as much as 140 billion gallons of fresh water annually in the United States, The farming of animals uses at least 34 trillion gallons of fresh water annually. The majority of the environmental problems we face today are being directly caused by animal agribusiness. And the most effective solution to these problems is the adoption of a vegan lifestyle and a plant-based diet. One year of veganism saves around 725,000 gallons of fresh water Which would take you 66 years to use in the shower. By choosing a vegan lifestyle and plant based diet, you automatically reduce your carbon dioxide output by 50% and use 91% less oil, 92% less water, and 89% less land. Each day, an individual vegan saves over a 1000 gallons of fresh water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 square feet of forests, 20 pounds of CO2, and the life of at least one animal. So if you want to do your part for the Earth, the only reasonable and responsible course of action is to adopt a vegan lifestyle and a plant-based diet."

So that involves talking about pollution, air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprints, and the climate crisis. And so when we talk about our carbon footprints in class, one of my favorite things to do is bring in these props that I made a year ago and Talk to my students about how we can decrease our carbon footprints as individuals, right? Because there's so many little simple things that we can do and so I have these props to kind of demonstrate how every single thing that we do has a footprint on the planet. And I wanted to show them to you. So these are Ziploc bags full of charcoal briquettes. So, not specifically coal, but it does the job to illustrate. And I have them all labeled for my own sanity. So I have however many pounds of CO2 emissions, and then in relation to that, how many pounds of coal you'd have to burn for those emissions. So I have some things, like this is a 10 minute hot shower. worth of coal this is one ready-made breakfast sandwich so like a frozen breakfast sandwich would count and i added this up for a meat cheese and egg so if you took one of those ingredients out if you're an egg and cheese kind of a person it would be less so this is for all three it's also the same as driving a car for 12 miles so i typically pair that one with this one which is about 12 miles of driving. So it's the same amount, 720 and a half grams. And so I like to put these two together because I'll say, this is a Chick-fil-A breakfast sandwich, right? Those are your carbon emissions from a Chick-fil-A breakfast sandwich. And then this is DoorDash delivering it to you if they have to drive six miles each way. So if you order your Chick-fil-A sandwich and have it delivered to you, this is the carbon footprint of that. Kind of fun. I've also got a latte with dairy. That one's a little smaller, but it still illustrates like one drink is that much. Still, you know, adds up if it's something you do every day. We've got a load of laundry. This is a big one on hot plus running the dryer. So that's like least sustainable laundry practices. So we talk about like using cold water, re-wearing your clothes so you don't have to do as much laundry, hang drying if you can even if that just means on a little drying rack, even if that means hang drying some of your clothes and not all of them. And this last one is one t-shirt. Now this is just to make a t-shirt and it's both of these bags full combined. So then we talk about the whole buying something new versus thrifting something versus like Imagine this being a t-shirt you buy for one party or one Halloween costume that you'll never wear again versus thrifting something you might need for a Halloween costume or coming up with something to be out of clothes you already own, stuff like that. So the whole purpose of this is just to kind of illustrate to college students that Every single person has the ability to make a difference. And we talk about what the world would look like if we lowered our carbon footprint by 1% or by 5%. And how much you'd have to do to do that. Like, how many less tanks of gas would you have to buy in a year to lower your carbon footprint by 1% or by 5%. Or if you, I don't know, thrift all of your clothes and that kind of offsets a little bit. Or some, if you thrift 40% of your clothes, what does that look like? And so just kind of getting them into the mindset of thinking about the world in a little bit of a different way. And I have fun with it. These went over really well last year. They were a really good conversation starter. And so we then started looking up the emissions of other things. They were interested in learning about like, oh, well, if that's a breakfast sandwich, then what's the carbon emissions of like a cheeseburger or whatever? And we just kind of went crazy and had a really, really good discussion. So I like to think that it'll be a little inspiring and not too scary. I always end every class though with some positive climate news so that we are not all negative. We gotta put a little bit of a positive spin on everything. I want to instill hope and inspiration, not dread. So we'll see how it goes this week."

If you care at all about the environment, you need to look into reducing your carbon footprint. One way to do that is with solar. Another way that's a lot less common is with a wind turbine. Obviously, you're not going to fit one in your backyard, but I mean, if you could, your neighbors probably wouldn't like it too much. When it comes to solar, you don't have to deal with the utility company's stupid laws and regulations. Put the solar up there, some nice black on black glass.

It's the speed at which we're adding carbon dioxide. This is not rocket surgery, people. Look at the graph. have gone from 280 parts per million to over 400 parts per million in just two centuries, rather than two millennia or ten millennia. We're doing it in ten years, for crying out loud. Let's go, people! Let's get to work! So to make it about me, my experience in seeing these people who are camping out, who feel this is such a dire situation, that they want to go and lock themselves to a pipeline. What do you say to people like that? Do you see that as effective protest? Is that an inspiring move or is that wasted energy? Well, does it prevent the pipeline? No. I think it creates noise. I think it delays potentially the inevitable. Yes. So maybe that's good. So there is potential energy in there. But the most effective thing would just be to have the climate change deniers Age out, as the saying goes. Very few climate change deniers are young. Not the cool thing.

Weather patterns might normalize, reducing extreme events like hurricanes and droughts. Agriculture would improve with longer growing seasons and more reliable rainfall. Economically, green jobs would surge, replacing fossil fuel industries, fostering innovation and clean technologies. Cities could transform into green spaces, enhancing quality of life. This bold scenario requires collective action, scientific innovation, and commitment to a sustainable future."

Normally I would plant a tree at like one of my relatives houses but we're running out of tree space so we're out here to pick up trash today. If you look around, there's very little of the native doom grass left. But there's tons of this barberry coming up. And the entire hillside is covered in English ivy, which is going up into the trees. Bits of trash here and there and everywhere. I was just on another video saying how much I hate balloon releases, and here's four and five. Number six. And we've got it. Lucky number seven, hidden in the bushes. Which makes it a pain for me. Birthdays are for inside. If you want streamers, if you want balloons, if you want confetti, do it in your damn house. And number eight. This one's a classic everywhere. I feel kind of bad about this one, but like... There's nobody here, there's no kids here, so this bucket is now just glitter. I don't want to be too graphic, so I'm gonna film from a distance. We have a dead seagull there and a dead Canada goose over there. It's hard to speculate what happened to those birds, you know, it could be natural causes, but just Looking around where I am now, we've got ribbon, perhaps they got choked, perhaps they got caught on it and then caught in some kind of driftwood like this and drowned. I've found birds like that while kayaking before that got caught on fishing line. There's bits of sharp plastic, lots of broken container lids, pill bottle caps, pop bottle caps, lots of things that can be harmful. I think there's a bit of straw a little further down here. There are plenty of man-made hazards that could contribute to the downfall of these birds, whether it was injuries internally or something that caused them to choke or drown. And we need to be conscious about how we are doing things outside, what we're bringing outside, and being sure to take at least everything we brought with us, or even more, leave less than what you brought with. Number nine. I kind of feel like there should be a tenth at this point, because it's just kind of an odd number of balloons, but I don't think they're all from the same birthday either. Someone's lost all of their colors. But yeah. Happy birthday, Killfish! I spoke too soon. We do have number ten. Disney. Please stop. Stop having beach birthdays. Okay guys, this is the final Earth Day haul for my little beach clean-out. We got even ten birthday balloons, lots of ribbon, the tips of cigarillos, bottle caps, straws, broken bits of plastic from like children's toys and like sand toys. a lot of stuff that could be hazardous to wildlife we actually have a couple of deceased birds over there the two lumps so if you're going to the beach please be conscious of what you bring and what you're doing um if you want a birthday party or some kind of celebration with decor and balloons and confetti and streamers like that's an indoor hobby right there like do your party inside where you can clean up your mess because right now all of this is In the beachfront, in our waterways, potentially harming our wildlife, our fish, our seabirds, putting microplastics into the water that we drink that gets put into our systems, so... I'm pretty happy. It could be way worse. Like, I should have been able to fill up a bigger trash bag if I went to a more popular beach. But, happy Earth Day, and when you go outside, be a good Earth citizen. Be a steward to nature. You know pick up more than what you've brought with because if we all pick up more than what we bring with us We can make the world a cleaner place and we can make it a beautiful place for the wildlife for our children for the future So thanks for joining me on this beach cleanup. I think I'm done"

This according to CEO of ExxonMobil and I guess climate change expert Darren Woods, who shared the discovery in a recent interview with Fortune. He revealed that the quote, dirty secret that nobody wants to talk about apparently is how much all this is going to cost and who's willing to pay for it. He also stated the people who create these emissions need to be aware and pay the price. He did not state what the price is for Exxon's 43.65 billion carbon tons of emissions generated from 1965 to 2020. But apparently it is just basic economics that makes Darren feel it's not Exxon's place to do anything about the extreme negative effects of their industry that they've known about for half a century. At a 2023 APEX CEO summit, Woods stated, when carbon reduction is economic, it will be everywhere. He continued, the constructive approach is to harness the industry's capabilities for change. Put us to work. We've got the tools, the skills, the size, and the intellectual and financial resources to bend the curve on emissions. We put that through a corporate gaslighting to English Translator, and what he reportedly meant was, we could curb emissions, we just won't. Unless you want to pay for it? Experts say Darren's deflect and blame strategy may have come from the gun industry, whose corporate responsibility-shirking tactics most notably include marketing assault weapons as a quote, modern sporting rifle, and then getting legislators to protect their profits by convincing the public that mass violence is an acceptable consequence for their product's availability. If you need help dealing with the burden of your responsibility for climate change, experts suggest moving through the five stages of grief. They warn that bargaining may be difficult as you'll have to work through what would have happened if big oil addressed the issue back in the 70s when they became aware of their impact, but depression is much easier. Just go outside and enjoy the unseasonably warm weather. And you do acceptance all the time. Industry will always be put ahead of you as long as consumers and the government view the negative impacts of products as a personal responsibility issue. Or you could join organizations like Guns Down America who are challenging that nasty status quo. Your choice."

That's the finding from a new study that looked at satellite data for the Big Apple, which is home to eight million people and roughly 275 skyscrapers. It measured subsidence, which is the gradual settling of soil. And it turns out New York City is sinking at a rate of one to two millimeters per year under all that weight. And while that might not sound like much, it's bad news for the low-lying city, much of which is only a meter or two above sea level. And outside of stopping the construction of new skyscrapers, there is a way to avoid increased flood risk in the future. The answer is limiting sea level rise, which means reducing greenhouse gas emissions and curtailing climate change."

Imagine harnessing the power of currents to influence weather patterns. By redirecting warm and cold currents, we could potentially stabilize climate extremes. Regions suffering from drought could receive more rainfall, while areas plagued by hurricanes could be shielded from their fury. Additionally, controlling currents could revolutionize global trade. Shipping routes could be optimized, drastically reducing travel time and fuel consumption leading to a more efficient economy. Energy generation could also see a transformation. Tidal and ocean current energy are underutilized resources. By enhancing these currents, we could create sustainable energy sources that power cities without harming the environment. However, the ethical implications are significant. Could this technology spark geopolitical tensions over control of oceanic regions? Would it disrupt marine ecosystems that rely on natural currents? As we explore this hypothetical scenario, it becomes clear that the ability to control ocean currents could reshape our world. But with great power comes great responsibility, and we must tread carefully in our quest for innovation."
https://www.tiktok.com/@homegrownnationalpark/video/7353072213416824107,"Let's return to the lawn. Lawn is the low-hanging fruit out there. It's what we can manipulate the easiest. We've got more than 44 million acres of lawn at this point, which is an area bigger than all of New England. What if we replanted half the area that is now in lawn, restored it? Let's make the math simple. Let's say we've got 40 million acres. We cut that area in half by restoring 20 million of those acres. That's enough to create what we are calling Homegrown National Park. And it will be a huge area. It'll be bigger than the Adirondacks, plus Yellowstone, plus Yosemite, plus Grand Tetas, Canyonlands, Mount Rainier, North Cascades, Badlands National Park, Olympic National Park, Sequoia National Park, plus the Grand Canyon. Plus Denali, which is huge. Plus the Great Smoky Mountains. If you add up all those parks, it's still less than 20 million acres. So Homegrown National Park will be the biggest park in the country. What are we asking? We really are asking people to reduce the area in lawn. Lawn doesn't accomplish any of the ecological goals that our properties need to accomplish. To do that by placing it with the native plants that do accomplish those goals. We want to remove invasive species from our properties, and protecting any natural areas, we certainly want to continue to do that. There are real ecological products associated with Homegrown National Park. Significant increases in biodiversity, and I'll give you some examples in a few minutes. Measurable reduction in invasive species. If everybody removed the invasive plants from their property, just from their property, we'd be 78% done. There's an urgency in enacting the homegrown national park solution. Remember that 135 million acres in residential landscapes? It's a big job. So we all need to get to work, and we all need to know what it is we have to do in order to succeed. Well, there's four things that every single property needs to accomplish ecologically if we're going to reach a sustainable relationship with the natural worlds that support us. We all have to. Every single property has to support a food web, every property has to sequester carbon, every property has to manage the watershed in which it lies, and every property has to support pollinators. Lawn accomplishes none of those goals, which is why we're focusing on it. We need to appreciate how important caterpillars are in local food webs. Caterpillars are more important than any other type of plant eater because they are transferring more energy from plants to other animals. And that's because so many things eat caterpillars. It turns out they are the meat and potatoes, the bread and butter of local food webs. If we design landscapes that don't have a lot of caterpillars in them, they're going to be failed food webs and eventually failed ecosystems. And that's why keystone plants, are essential to our landscapes because they support the most caterpillars. Remember what a keystone is. It's the stone in the middle of the Roman arch. And if you take that stone out of the arch, the arch collapses. Well, if you take keystone plants out of the local food web, the food web collapses. Just 14% of our native plants are supporting 90% of the caterpillar food that drives those food webs. That 14% are the keystone plants in our nation. Keystone plants in an ecological house that you're building as the two-by-fours that hold that house up, they are the support system. You can't have an ecological house without them. And we can't build a house out of wallpaper, which is what we've been doing with our ornamental plants for the last century. We have to recognize how important small properties can be to conservation. Remember, 82% of us live in and around cities, so we all have a responsibility to conservation, and that includes people with tiny properties. And if you have no property at all, Container gardening can be very effective. Let's say you live in an apartment. Use container gardening with native plants. You can still supply pollen and nectar to a number of our pollinators to migrating monarchs. If everybody in that apartment building did it, just picture what's a pile of bricks would be really actually a well-planted ecosystem. Fortunately, we do have a silver bullet in our fight against both climate change and biodiversity crisis. They both have a similar solution, and that is that conservation works. And there's a number of examples of this. There's an area in Illinois called the Nachusa Grasslands. It's 3,800 acres in size. There are now more than 730 native plant species in that space. 180 species of birds use it. It used to be a cornfield. Point is, nature is enormously resilient. Now there's something common to each one of these conservation approaches, and that is whether or not they succeed depends on the decisions that you and I make. I had a student in my class a few years ago, Amanda Crandall, she was writing a final exam, and she said, while conservationists claim to be managing species and habitats, What we're really managing is people, and that is so true. We need to change our adversarial relationship with nature to a collaborative one. That is the only path forward. And the question is, can we do this? Well, of course we can do this. You don't have to save biodiversity for a living, but you can save it where you live, and if you do, it empowers you. More and more people recognize that the Earth has some serious environmental challenges these days, but most people feel powerless. What can one person do? Well, one person can shrink the lawn. One person can modify your light system. One person can add a pollinator garden. One person can use container gardening. One person can remove invasive plants. One person can garden with keystone plants. One person can fire your mosquito fire. One person can join Homegrown National Park. There's a lot of things one person can do to totally revitalize the ecosystem on their property and then enhance their greater local ecosystem instead of continuing to detract from it. And this also shrinks the problem down to something that's manageable for each one of us. Don't think about the entire Earth's problems. You'll get depressed. Just worry about the piece of the Earth that you can manage. If you own property, it's obvious that's where you start. If you don't own property, help somebody who does. Help a land conservancy. Help a park or preserve. They're all underfunded. They're all understaffed. They will love you as a volunteer. So I hope Homegrown National Park will provide the motivation and the guidance for millions of people to tackle these conservation challenges. Because whether or not we do that now is going to determine nature's fate and then ultimately our own. Here's how to use some of the tools that Homegrown National Park has put together to help you get started and make this movement grow at the speed that the biodiversity crisis demands. A great first step is to download the keystone guides for your ecoregion. Under resources you'll find guides for trees and shrubs as well as smaller plants that are container friendly so you can participate on your patio or balcony. Also under Resources is our directory. Since the details of planting native varies so much from region to region, the best resources for products and information are almost always local. The directory shows local nurseries that have native plants and seeds for purchase. If we don't yet have any local services listed for your area, there are still many suppliers who will ship native plants nationwide. Just enter your state name into the search field to get a list of every resource that provides services in your area. If you prefer to hire a landscape professional for installation or maintenance, you'll find these listings here as well. And you'll also find nonprofits that can help you learn more. Your closest wild ones or native plant society are always a good bet for information. Another great first step is to download a plant ID app like iNaturalist so you can take an inventory of the plants already on your property and learn if they are native, non-native, or invasive. Next, you'll want to make your contributions known by entering your new or existing native plantings on the HNP biodiversity map. The map is designed to be the epicenter of biodiversity regeneration, consolidating and measuring everyone's efforts. It doesn't replace what any individuals or groups are doing, but amplifies and consolidates all these actions, creating a dynamic visual pinpointing where actions are thriving and where they are desperately needed. Entries can be as small as one square foot, or you can even get on the map with just a planting goal. When you get on the map as an individual, your plantings aren't publicly identified, but businesses, corporations, nonprofits, and other types of organizations have the option to publicly identify their planting sites and invite employees or members to work together toward a common planting goal. We have additional instructionals to help you get on the map and also have a planting calculator to help you estimate the size of your native plantings. Then follow us for tips, examples, and inspiration. We have an email newsletter that is sent several times a month, and we're active on Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook, and we also have a very active Facebook group. We also have many ways you can tell your friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers about this movement. You can find these options under the H&P & You section of the site. One of the best and simplest ways to show off your native habitat is through one of our yard signs available for purchase. You'll also find a social media post with text, information on how to show this What's the Rest presentation to your community, and events materials to hand out. Check out the Partnerships page for different types of partnerships available. And of course, since H&P is powered by your generosity, donating is always a great way to support this movement. Thank you for watching What's the Rush? We hope you're inspired to action and are thrilled to"

First, we would see a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, leading to improved air quality and significant progress in combating climate change. With solar, wind and hydroelectric power becoming predominant, fossil fuel dependence would diminish, allowing natural ecosystems to recover. Economically, the shift could create millions of jobs in green technologies and infrastructure development, positioning nations as leaders in an emerging green economy. We would also witness energy independence for many countries, reducing geopolitical tensions tied to oil resources. Imagine cities powered entirely by solar panels and wind turbines, with innovative storage solutions ensuring a stable energy supply. Additionally, the decline in pollution-related health issues would lead to lower healthcare costs and a healthier population. On a societal level, there would be a cultural shift towards sustainable practices, changing consumption behaviors, and prioritizing ecological balance. This transition, while requiring upfront investment, could result in long-term savings and a more resilient economy, as renewable sources are sustainable and often cheaper than fossil fuels. The future could be brighter, cleaner, and more equitable for all."

This up here, that shading of red, you can see the climate shift index on the top portion of your screen. That is five times as likely to experience the heat they see today by climate change. So here are the numbers. Very hot, that's obviously well discussed and ad nauseum sometimes, but when we're talking about how much heat and how this is impacting people, we've got over 100 million Americans under these heat alerts, and it's not just the mercury and the thermometer, it's when you factor the humidity levels, that makes it so oppressive for many of the East Coast cities. Look at our nation's capital flirting with 100. We'll reach triple digits for Rapid City, all the way to Dallas, even portions of the Intermountain West. Baked into all that heat, of course, are the ongoing wildfires over the western parts of the country. 93 active wildfires, some in California, some in the state of Oregon as well. So, when we have this amount of heat, it gives our tropical systems more ability to hold water vapor The National Hurricane Center has this movement into the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Pretty jacked up how he died. He shouldn't have died. I don't think he should have died at all, you know, because they quit. They took away medication that was working and they put it on something else and he didn't even want to stay in the hospital and they imprisoned there. That's another story. But I am... I've been trying to continue. My dad was a pastor and had formed churches and had a non-profit organization that helped people and such, so... Since my father's died, I am trying to continue his mission of sharing God's love and spreading the gospel so people's souls can be saved. I am probably the worst example of a Christian that you could possibly find. I'm a sinner, I know I'm a sinner, and I do my best not to be a sinner and not to do wrong and do bad things. And, you know, but the fact of the matter is, the Bible says that we're still gonna, if you say that you do not sin, then you're a liar. Because everybody sins until the day we die and then we'll be born again in perfection and we won't be able to sin anymore because we'll be perfect and we'll be like diamonds that have been, like pure diamonds that can never be, Corrupted. So, uh, anybody that thinks they're sinless or perfect on the earth, or that they're for some reason better than anyone else, unless you're an airborne paratrooper with 82nd Airborne, then, you know, you're not. Everyone on this earth is imperfect and we need God, we need Jesus. you know, to save our souls. Because no matter how good you are, even if you're the best airborne paratrooper there are, there's always someone better, and no one's better than Jesus Christ. And, uh, I had to say airborne paratrooper because I was in the 82nd Airborne Division, and it's an elite unit, and airborne people think they're just better than anyone, and in some ways you get the best equipment, you have the best training, and My unit, every 82nd Airborne, every objective that we took, we kept. So Strike Hall was the name of 504th, which I was in. So I probably shouldn't have said that because I don't like to give too much information to internet scammers because they can take your information and find out stuff about you. And I use this information to, Screen people like scammers trying to pretend to be my friend and steal my information and my photos from my personal account which they've done to my brother and he did like nothing to protect himself and they massively scammed like stole his identity and it's a big mess I tried to clean it up and help him out with that and turned into be a bigger mess and that's another story and it's not what I'm on this topic about right here so This topic is about sort of the life cycle of our star. And would you believe it, but there might be a passage about our star going into its next phase. So, start with the verse that we're starting with here. 2 Peter 3.10, it says, okay, well, it's not right here, where is it? I'm looking for the verse. Here it is. 2 Peter 3. It's the New Testament. Chapter 10, verse 10 through 18. And it says, But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night. People believe this is what, this is what people believe in the rapture, which there is no biblical support for the rapture. That is just some, I think someone came up with some church and people just accepted it as fact and it was never biblically supported and it is not. So the rapture is not a thing. And there's a couple of verses that come together for a reason why people think it is, but it's not a thing, okay? Anyway, so, The day of the Lord will come as the thief of the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise. So, heavens in this case must mean the sky. It says the heavens shall pass away with a great noise. Which, I'll just read it first and then analyze it. But the light of the world will come as a thief of the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with a fervent heat, and the earth also, and the works therein, shall be burned up. This is the King James Version. I have another... where is it? I like to go to the original text, which I believe is in Greek in this case. Where is it? I'm sorry, I had this prepared, but somehow it got mixed up. I like to have the, it breaks down several different verses here. I have it here somewhere. Well, I'm a little bit disorganized here, I guess. Maybe it's over here. Nope, nope, nope. Anyway, so that's fine, that's enough. So, I'd like to compare the different translations for a better, clearer understanding because different languages, like I have, I know a second language, I can speak German, and German words sometimes are a more complete idea in one word. Sometimes the words are like this long. But it's a complete idea in one word. And sometimes reading the German Bible, I learn more about what I know of the Bible by reading it in German, which was translated by Martin Luther into German from another language, which I forget. I know this because I was at the museum where he had a lot of his writings. Anyway, so... According to this verse, it says, Heaven shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with a fervent heat, and also the works therein shall be burned up. Some verses say the earth will be laid bare, but the great noise is part of it, and the elements melting, right? Some people say it's the earth melting, and some people think that the elements are like things that you use to worship God, so like a church burns up. But, I think this has more to do with science and the life cycle of our solar system and our sun. Because... I mean, you can go ahead and look at videos about this because there's a lot of them on the internet. Okay. The toast is done. Okay, so... Let's see. So here's the life cycle of our Earth. Right? Of our sun. So it started as a stellar nebula where God just rolled it all together and said let there be light and then there was light and then he started turning and then there was a day and a night and then the sun formed and then the moon and such. So right here is where we're at. But the sun is gonna go red giant. Because the fuel, the sun eventually is gonna run out of fuel. And people think it's going to be billions and billions of years, and they don't think about how close we might be, because we don't know how much fuel, you know, there's no fuel gauge on the Sun to tell us how much fuel it has, because it's inside of it. You know, and this fuel will burn up, and then the Sun will turn into a red giant, maybe a red super giant, I don't know, and then it'll become a planetary nebula, and then it'll be a white dwarf, right? So, whether or not the earth survives this depends on how big of a red giant our sun becomes. There are verses that say the earth will be there forever, and then this verse says the earth will melt, right? It doesn't say it will be completely destroyed, it says it will be melted and be laid barren, or As that verse said, what did it say? The works therein shall be burned up. So that kind of tells us that things that we've done here will all be eliminated. Like everything on the earth is gonna be, you know, everything we worked for and done here, gone. For me, this is a good reason to have like Elon Musk start building a space arc so we can go further out in the solar system and some of humanity can survive this. Those that want to. You know. I mean, Noah wasn't a rich dude and everybody made fun of him. I mean, he's a hard worker and only him and his family survived. So, maybe somebody builds a rocket and a space ark and goes and saves humanity from this event. I know it sounds like sci-fi, right? It sounds totally like sci-fi, but this... It says, the heavens shall pass away with a great noise. The elements shall melt with a fervent heat, and the earth also, and the works therein shall be burned up. So... Okay, let's look at... So the Sun goes supernova, and it burns the Earth. So some models say that the Earth is just gonna be completely burned up because it's gonna be inside the red giant. You know, it's gonna be inside the circle where the red giant gets bigger. I think maybe it goes out as far as Jupiter. So the inner solar system is gonna be swallowed up by the Sun. That depends on how much fuel is in our star, our sun. So, maybe and maybe not. If you take other verses in context, then the earth A beautiful, shining, Cube. It measures it. Maybe it's not a cube, maybe it's just... diamond shape. I don't know. But for me, it's the closest sci-fi thing I can think of that would make it like... It's like a Borg cube, right? And roughly, maybe the size of a Borg cube next to it. It's in the Revelations, if you want to look it up. But, uh... So... Let's see. That's not at all what I'm looking for. So anyway, the sun, our sun is gonna go at some point, it's gonna turn into a red giant. That's just, we can see other star systems that this happens to, and it would tend to, if you believe the Bible's true, right? I'm trying to reconcile science with the ancient record of creation and prophecies of what's going to happen to the earth. A lot of prophecies in the Bible have happened. A lot. I think it's somewhere over 200, maybe 500. A lot of prophecies, things that were predicted, happened in the Bible. So, it says it's gonna be burned up and everything's gonna be laid empty, laid barren. I'm just gonna go look this verse up again real quick. So, what would that look like? Would anyone survive? Apparently, some people would survive because there's gonna be... There's gonna be... People living for a thousand years with God, like hanging out, chilling, you know, on New Jerusalem. There's going to be people that have lived in the presence of God for a thousand years and, you know, the devil gets locked up for a thousand years and he's released to tempt people again at the end of this thousand year reign. So, anyway, so, let me look for my verses here. I'm just going to look it up again. Elements shall melt with fervent heat. Verse. Let's go. Verse. The Lord will come like a thief in the night, and the heavens will disappear with a roar. So, just think about it. When the sun goes supernova, right? It's going to be like an explosion. There's going to be a shockwave. Probably a sound, right? The heavens will disappear. I think that's going to be the shockwave and the roar, like a big sound. New International Version says, Heavens will disappear with the roar, so it's probably going to rip away the atmosphere. At least part of it. And the New Living Translation says, The heavens will pass away with the terrible noise and the elements themselves will disappear in fire and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment. So it says, Heavens will pass away with the war. The heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved. So maybe Mercury, Venus, and maybe even the Moon and the Earth and the works that are done will be exposed. So this verse says exposed. And it says the Earth and its works will be laid bare. The elements will be destroyed by fire. So this sounds very much like A cataclysmic event where the sun runs out of fuel, goes supernova with a shockwave, terrible noise, and the heavens will be ripped away. And the Earth will be led bare and everything that we've done here on the planet will be destroyed. I mean, how would you prepare all our stuff that we built to withstand the sun sending out a shockwave when it goes to its next phase of its life? So... I can see this stuff. The sun will go supernova. So anyway, that is the verse, and it's something to think about. Here's something that people think, like after that happened and the sun goes back to, ugh. Some of these websites don't like to show me stuff. I don't know if you can see that. This is like a skyline, and behind the skyline is a nova. So like, the sun went huge, red giant, and then went down to Nova, and then it's gonna be like a dwarf. Is this one? Let me see this one. See that one. Yeah. Except for in the, according to the verse, all of this would be destroyed, right? Everything would be laid bare. And maybe that's what it would look like after. I don't know. But if you're gonna like look into a scientific event that might explain this verse that prophesied what's gonna happen, Then that fits perfectly with You know life cycle of our star and when it goes for a giant will definitely melt the heavens and Some heavenly bodies such as mercury and Venus. They'll be gone The earth apparently will survive but it's gonna suffer from it and It actually doesn't say that all of humanity will be destroyed. It doesn't say that we will all die. I'm sure a lot of people will die, but it doesn't say that all of humanity will die. People perhaps on the opposite side of the planet, when this happens, will all survive. So like half of the Earth, if humanity dies or suffers from this event on the other side of the planet, Humanity survives, but you know, I have to deal with all the shockwave tearing away the up the atmosphere and such so I Know just something to think about and it's a way that this verse This prophecy could happen I mean, I'm not gonna go outside and put it like a big sign of myself the end of the world is near But we really don't know when the Sun is gonna run out of fuel and this is gonna happen. I But it might be sooner than later, so maybe it's worth preparing your soul for the next life. Or maybe it's worth preparing spacecraft to take humanity further out into the atmosphere. Maybe it's worth setting up a colony on Mars so that we're further out when this happens. Or maybe, I don't know, Iowa or Pluto? Who knows? Who knows how big the red giant will be? According to what is prophesied, the Earth will survive. It's going to suffer for it. It's not going to be the same after. But it should survive this event. Some of the videos you can look up and find of people talking about this say the Earth won't survive because if the sun goes to the red giant big enough, it will swallow the Earth. But That's just one verse, and other verses say what's gonna happen later, so. Anyway, so that is this story, and I have another one that I wanted to, another topic I wanted to get onto. Oh yeah, so this is like ultimate climate change, and there's absolutely zero we can do to prevent this from happening. You can't do enough... I mean, solar panels, you want solar panels? They'll be supercharged, but they'll also be destroyed. So this is the ultimate form of climate change. And the only thing you can do to prepare for it is get straight with God, get a relationship with Christ. So if you're on the wrong side of the planet when that happens, When you die, you will be in a better place with the Lord, right? And the redeemed. So, yeah, there's other topics I wanna hit on, and this is just, stuff's been percolating in my brain. Anyway, so, something to think about."

Okay, so before I get into this, just know the world recorded its hottest month on record in May. Yeah, the hottest month ever in history. So basically a heat dome is an area with very high pressure. Now what that high pressure does is it keeps the heat from coming up from the ground. Heat must rise. So with all this added pressure, In almost like a dome-like area, it keeps the heat compressed. Now, why is this bad? Because they're becoming longer and more frequent, and it's all due to climate change. So basically what they're saying is that one right there in Mexico has been sitting there for several weeks, which is crazy because they usually only last maybe a week. We're talking heat indexes of like 104 to 107 for weeks. So what does that do? It dries up the ground. It's not good for our crops. Oh yeah, and on top of that, there's more heat-related illnesses such as heat strokes, sun poisoning. I mean, it goes on and on. So basically what the weather guy said was that usually the jet stream goes in a certain way and this year they predicted it wrong. So none of these are being blown away. They're just sticking around. So be careful and be prepared because it is about to be very, very hot. Something is going on with our climate."

https://www.tiktok.com/@liloceanpaige/video/7415713367412804894,"Two years ago, this volcano went kaboomy and put millions of gallons of water vapor, which is a greenhouse gas, into Earth's atmosphere. Which begs the question, was this boom boom the reason why the last two summers have been so painfully hot? A greenhouse gas is any gas in Earth's atmosphere that absorbs the heat that the hard rock of Earth is emitting. This eruption increased the amount of greenhouse gases So, yes, it has caused a temporary increase in warming. But it's important that we look at the overall trend. There is an observatory sitting on the top of the Big Island of Hawaii that has been recording carbon dioxide emissions for now 60 years. These observations show carbon dioxide increasing over the last 60 years and you've probably seen a figure like this before. You now might be wondering, Paige, if water vapor is a greenhouse gas, why aren't we observing that? Where are those measurements? We don't really measure and observe water vapor because it's always present in Earth's atmosphere. Regardless of our human activity, things are going to evaporate, precipitate. Water vapor will always be there. The trend in warming that we've seen since pre-industrial times is very much correlated with the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But it's not a perfect correlation. Year to year variations in Earth's climate are very common, and these are often linked to things like volcanoes, for example, Mount Pinatubo or El Niño La Niña. These definitely change Earth's climate, but they're short year to maybe three year variations. The overall trend in temperature is going up, seen by the bars on this graph compared to the overall trend In carbon dioxide, which is also going up seen by this line. But there's another reason why carbon dioxide and Earth's temperature don't have a perfect correlation. It's the ocean. Water is far more efficient than air at storing heat and energy. Mama Osh is taking up a ton of heat and energy and a good portion of that is converted to higher temperatures. But as you may notice, the higher temperatures are not evenly distributed. So what have we learned, my dear scientists? We have learned that yes, this kaboomy did contribute to already rising amounts of greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere. These additional greenhouse gases have contributed to an already rising warming trend. Think of it as the sprinkles on top of the cake. Volcanoes can have a significant warming or cooling effect on Earth's atmosphere, but volcanoes alone cannot explain. this."

In 2023, for the first time in history, a storm system of Category 5 formed in each ocean basin. And almost every hurricane of this category set a record for strength, duration, and speed of intensification. Previously, when hurricanes rapidly intensified, they typically evolved their category up one level within 24 hours. For example, a category two hurricane would grow into category three hurricane within a day. This is known as rapid intensification. But now, because of the abnormal ocean heating that is happening from below, hurricanes have started accelerating at insane speeds. Hurricane Otis shocked climatologists when in less than 12 hours it intensified from a regular tropical storm into a category five hurricane, the highest category. In other words, it went up five levels in just half a day. This has never been observed before. Otis hit Mexican coast on October 25th, 2023 with a speed of 170 miles per hour.

If you felt like this summer was hotter than summers just even a few years ago, you're not wrong. Let's do a quick recap of the heat across the U.S. this summer. Any of these areas in light pink all the way to the dark red saw at least one day where the summer heat was made more likely by climate change. Some of those harder hit areas include the southwest and across most of the south heading all the way into Florida. Even Hawaii and Puerto Rico are in those dark red colors as well. If you're in any of those regions, you likely saw at least half of your summer days, if not most of your summer days, having higher temperatures that can be directly traced back to climate change. And this summer, 26 cities across the U.S. saw extreme dangerous heat waves. And with these heat waves in all 26 cities, climate change made not only the intensity of these heat waves, but also the length of them 14 times more likely to occur. Climate change is no longer a distant problem. If you live in the United States, likely you were affected by climate change induced heat this summer. In fact, 99% of the US saw at least one day where climate change made those temperatures more likely to occur.

https://www.tiktok.com/@nomamessquintycuh/video/7442527281689496862,"Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago through a process known as accretion. Initially, the solar system was a swirling cloud of gas and dust, called the solar nebula, which began to collapse under its own gravity. As the cloud condensed, it flattened into a spinning disk, with particles of dust and gas beginning to collide and stick together due to gravity and electrostatic forces. These small particles grew larger over time, eventually forming planetesimals, which were asteroid-like bodies that served as building blocks for planets. Through continued collisions and gravitational attraction, these planetesimals merged to form larger bodies. The early Earth grew by accumulating material from these collisions, a process that generated intense heat. During this molten state, heavier elements like iron and nickel sank to the center, forming the Earth's core, while lighter elements rose to form the crust. As the planet continued to cool, water vapor condensed to form oceans, providing the conditions necessary for the development of life. Earth's formation was a complex process influenced by cosmic collisions, gravitational forces and the dynamics of the solar system. This resulted in the habitable planet we know today. Earth's history is marked by transformative events that shaped its environment and brought forth life. From its fiery beginnings to the emergence of life, Earth's story is one of incredible change and resilience. Each era brought new challenges and opportunities, leading to the remarkable diversity of life we witness today. As life evolved, so too did the complex relationships between species and their surroundings. Innovation and culture flourished, allowing humanity to adapt and thrive in a changing world. Through ingenuity and collaboration, humans have shaped the world around them, becoming stewards of the planet. In recent decades, awareness of our planet's fragility has led to movements aimed at preserving its beauty and resources for future generations. This commitment to stewardship fosters hope and inspires new generations to cultivate a better world. As we move forward, the fusion of knowledge and passion empowers humanity to address the challenges ahead. Reflecting on our shared journey, it becomes clear that our collective actions shape the future of this remarkable planet. Together, communities are stepping up to protect and celebrate the Earth, ensuring its vitality for years to come. Emphasizing the intrinsic value of nature, people are rediscovering their bond with the Earth and advocating for its protection. As we confront the pressing challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, the call for action grows louder and more urgent. These powerful moments remind us that every action counts in safeguarding the future of our planet. Through unity and creativity, humanity has the potential to forge a sustainable path forward.

A lot of us are becoming really, really numb to this type of event, these unprecedented events throughout the world and within our own countries. But something I think that we're not talking enough about is the toll that war and bombings and continued DoD action actually puts on the environment because Yes, we need to be thinking of the human side of this and all of the people unjustly being unalived through these events. But also there is this fallout and domino effect that comes from engaging in warfare and then leading to more climate damages and climate change. Wars destroy not only communities and human lives, but they also destroy vegetation and release a lot of stored carbon. For instance, look historically during the Vietnam War, anywhere from 14 to 44% of their forests were lost because of the military actions. The Department of Defense in the United States in general is one of the most major, if not the single dropping bombs no matter where it is happening it disrupts and destroys infrastructure but it also creates long-lasting emissions and continued fuel burning and each drop of a bomb is not just the destruction that happens initially but it has a footprint that lasts If we look at the collective of how much destruction, devastation, and emissions are being released in the use of fossil fuels through the DoD and these ongoing conflicts around the world, They're only intensifying climate change. We're likely to see more extreme weather events like Hurricane Helene. Areas that are already weakened because of conflicts are even more susceptible or if we're seeing like in Appalachia, more impoverished communities, they are extremely vulnerable to this destruction and it is completely tied to the actions of our governments and what they are funding. Although there was funding approved for this disaster, the director of FEMA stated that their budget only really accounted for them being able to help in one major crisis or one major storm. I'm not sure if they have enough funding or money to actually pay for these damages that are oftentimes directly caused by climate change, which is directly influenced by military action. And the hypocrisy of it all is that we're funding these actions. We are funding Hurricane Helene and future hurricanes and future natural disasters by contributing to this ongoing conflict unnecessarily."

Satellite imagery from recent months shows it gradually heading north towards open water. The size is enormous, with a surface area of about 1,500 square miles. Iceberg A23A is larger than the state of Rhode Island. Dr. Andrew Myers joins us. He's a polar ocean science leader with the British Antarctic Survey and has studied the iceberg in person. So take us up close and personal. You've seen this iceberg, but what does it look like? It's really impressive to see. It's a colossal wall of ice that extends from one horizon to the other. So we spent around about seven hours steaming just along this wall of ice that's around about 40 or so meters high. So it's effectively a wall on one side of your ship, as far as you can see. Well, you know, glaciers up close, you know, can look a little dirty, right, because of the air and other types of pollution. Is this relatively clean because it's been on the ocean floor, or what's sort of the texture of it? So it's very pristine white ice. So this ice has basically been sitting on the Antarctic continent for many thousands or even millions of years since it first fell as snow. And then it moved out into the ocean as part of an ice shelf before 40 years ago, snapping off and sitting more or less in the same place near the Antarctic coastline. And then about two years ago, it came loose and has been working its way out of the sea ice. And just a few months ago, we were there, as you can see in the footage, and it is now making its way northwards out into the open ocean. Wow. You know, I'm just putting my glasses on there to look at that a little bit. It's almost like a little bit blue along the ridge with the water. Is that just a reflection or is that actually the color of the ice? Yeah, I think that is largely a reflection, but you can get some absolutely beautiful ice. This ice here is largely white. That's due to tiny air bubbles that are actually trapped inside the ice, which actually have a really great scientific purpose for actually allowing us to measure the air from thousands of years ago. But you can get other sorts of ice. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So you're saying there's air trapped in that ice that's allowing you to assess what the atmosphere was like maybe 10 or 20 or 30,000 years ago? Absolutely. One of the projects of the British Antarctic Survey that we undertake is we take ice balls. At the moment, they're searching for a million-year-old core, so that allows us to measure ice back in millions of years. That's really how we understand what the climate looked like over very long timescales before humans started effectively changing it. Wow, that's an incredible benchmark, right, as we try and understand how climate is changing in the modern day. Okay, so where is it heading now? So this is heading out into what's known as Iceberg Alley. So the process of icebergs breaking off from these ice shelves is quite a natural process. This is a very abnormally large one, though. And this will move off into the open ocean. As it encounters that sea ice-free water, which is significantly warmer, it will gradually break up. But because it is so massive, it could go a very long way and potentially interact with some of the sub-Antarctic islands and all the wildlife that live on its way. And just in the last few seconds, I mean, how did you get interested in this area of science? Is it like being young and you want to be an archaeologist and you woke up one day and went, Eureka, I want to be an ice scientist? How does that work? Well, I always loved the ocean. I grew up near the ocean and it was something I wanted to do. But it's a really important part of the global climate. The Southern Ocean actually takes up most of the heat that humans have actually generated since the start of the Industrial Revolution. And it's how it changes into the future, which is something we really poorly understand and is influenced by these mega icebergs as they melt, is something that has great potential consequences for our future in the coming decades and centuries. So it's something that I'm really passionate about understanding and getting to go to these places and see icebergs like this is really one of the big bonuses."

This is just one day, not even one day, this is like one bombing event. From the blue and white flag in Beirut. Look at the smoke. Just one. So you know what's been going on in Gaza? I'm sure you do. What do you think is happening to the cosmos and to the environment? Yeah, it's there, not here in the USA. But we know global is global. And what we did in, what we're doing in Ukraine, what we were doing in Syria, what we did in Iraq. But none of that really matters when it comes to global warming. We're only talking about toxic fossil fuel that's causing the problem. But when it comes to war and putting all that in the cosmos out there and putting that in the universe, that's okay. That's totally okay. Look at this. This is in a neighborhood, residential neighborhood. Talking about health, talking about what's happening to the people's health, and you wonder why people get sick? That's not global warming. That's not global warming.

Imagine a world where we can summon rain to end droughts, prevent hurricanes from causing destruction, or ensure sunny skies for important events. The benefits seem endless. We could stabilize food production by providing consistent rainfall, reduce natural disasters, and even combat climate change. But with great power comes great responsibility. Weather control could also lead to geopolitical conflicts as nations might compete to influence weather patterns to their advantage. Countries could weaponize weather, triggering droughts or floods as acts of war. The ethical implications are staggering. Who gets to decide which regions receive rain and which ones experience drought? Would this technology be available to all or just a privileged few? Moreover, the environment is an intricate system and tampering with one aspect could have unforeseen consequences. Altering weather patterns could disrupt ecosystems leading to a cascade of negative effects on wildlife and plant life. The delicate balance of our planet's climate could be thrown into chaos. What do you think? Would the ability to control the weather be a dream come true? Or a Pandora's box best left unopened?

A journey through the innovations and solutions paving the way for a more sustainable planet. Let's dive into the developments shaping how we care for our world. As we face challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss and resource depletion, innovative solutions are emerging to protect and restore ecosystems. One key area is technology. Scientists are using advanced tools like drones and satellite imaging to monitor forest health, track wildlife and even map coral reefs in real time. These technologies help us understand ecosystem changes and respond more effectively to threats. In agriculture, sustainable practices are revolutionising food production. Techniques like vertical farming, regenerative agriculture and precision farming reduce environmental impact while maximising yields. These methods work in harmony with nature, promoting soil health, conserving water and supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Renewable energy is another game changer. Shifting from fossil fuels to wind, solar and hydroelectric power not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but also lessens the strain on ecosystems impacted by mining and drilling. Paired with energy storage advancements, these innovations make clean energy more accessible and reliable. Ecosystem restoration is also gaining momentum. Projects like reforestation and wetland recovery aim to bring damaged ecosystems back to life. In urban areas, green infrastructure like rooftop gardens, rainwater harvesting systems and tree-lined streets enhances biodiversity while improving quality of life for humans. On a global scale, collaborative efforts like the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and initiatives like the Trillion Trees Campaign highlight the importance of working together. From governments and corporations to communities and individuals, Everyone has a role to play in safeguarding our planet. But innovation isn't just about large-scale efforts. Small actions like reducing waste, supporting eco-friendly businesses and spreading awareness ripple outward to create meaningful change. The future of ecosystems is in our hands, guided by creativity, collaboration and a commitment to sustainability. Together, we can build a world where ecosystems thrive, biodiversity flourishes, and humans live in harmony with nature. Thank you for joining me in the Cozy Lab to envision the possibilities ahead. Until next time, stay curious and take care."

As we huddled together in the aftermath, surrounded by debris and uncertainty, I felt a deep sense of loss and helplessness. But amidst the chaos, a spark ignited within me, a determination to understand the forces that had brought us to this point. The days following the storm were a blur of emergency shelters, insurance claims, and trying to salvage what little we could. But each night, as I lay on a hard cot, I couldn't stop thinking about the bigger picture. I started researching climate change, realizing that this wasn't just a freak event, but part of a larger, more alarming trend. The more I learned, the more my grief transformed into a burning resolve to make a difference. I began attending local climate action meetings, finding solace and strength in a community of like-minded individuals. We organized rallies, educated others, and lobbied for policy changes. My story of loss became a powerful testament to the urgent need for action, and I found a new purpose in advocating for a sustainable future.

Do we expect the large ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland To be able to recover from the melting that we're experiencing now, or do we expect them to cross tipping points where the world could really have 10, 15 or more meters of sea level rise from crossing those thresholds? That's all happening between one and a half and two degrees warming. And that is why scientists here have such an important message to bring to the world, which is we can't give up on those goals.

All it takes is increasing the minimum wind speed at which wind turbine blades start to spin, because bats tend to fly around in high numbers when it isn't very windy. Right now, most wind turbine blades start spinning at wind speeds of 6.71 mph. New research published by an international team of bat experts has shown that increasing that speed to 10.1 mph can significantly reduce bat collisions with wind turbine blades. A recent trial run of this curtailment method in Australia resulted in 54% fewer bat fatalities, but that's not all. It only led to a 0.16% reduction in energy output and a 0.09% reduction in revenue. That means wind farm operators can do the right thing for the planet without sacrificing profit or output and without having to invest in expensive technologies. Some wind farm operators in North America and Europe already use this curtailment method, but it's not as common elsewhere in the world. Australia, though, is in the process of revamping their guidelines for onshore wind farms, and it currently calls for shutting down turbines when wind speeds are low in order to protect both bats and birds. So just because there are known issues with climate solutions does not mean they are being ignored. In fact, it's quite the opposite.

Initially, the project, which aimed to reflect sunlight and cool the planet by injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, was hailed as a technological marvel. It brought immediate relief from the rising temperatures and declining polar ice, creating an optimistic outlook for the future of our planet. However, as the months turned into years, the climate began to show unexpected changes, with some regions experiencing severe droughts while others were inundated with relentless rainfall. These drastic shifts in weather patterns sparked a chain reaction across the globe. Agricultural outputs were disrupted, leading to food shortages in several countries. The nations most affected by these changes, particularly those with economies heavily reliant on agriculture, began to voice their discontent. Accusing the leading powers behind the geoengineering effort of negligence and demanding reparations. The Global South, which had contributed the least to climate change but was suffering the most from its mitigation side effects, called for an urgent international summit to address the mounting crisis. As tensions rose, old geopolitical rivalries were reignited, while new alliances formed in response to the shifting balance of power. Countries with advanced technological capabilities and resources to adapt to the new climate became increasingly influential on the world stage. Meanwhile, developing nations, struggling to cope with the rapid changes, sought aid and support, leading to complex negotiations and strategic partnerships. The United Nations, tasked with mediating these disputes, found itself overwhelmed, as nations threatened to withdraw from climate agreements and pursue unilateral actions to secure their interests. Amidst the geopolitical turmoil, scientists scrambled to understand the unintended consequences of the geoengineering project and propose solutions to stabilize the climate once again. The world faced a critical choice, to continue down the path of technological intervention, with all its risks and uncertainties, or to prioritize sustainable practices and cooperation.

The agricultural sector would face severe challenges due to changing climate patterns, leading to potentially widespread food shortages. Addressing these impacts would require unprecedented global cooperation and adaptation strategies."

What about his performance? That's not the most important thing that we should be paying attention to. The problem isn't that he's just old. The problem is he's insane. Only a madman would not consider a nuclear holocaust, a nuclear war, as an existential threat. He said, quote, the only existential threat to humanity is climate change. End of quote. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. Only an insane person would say this. And this exact insane person has the power to launch a nuclear weapon. How could we even consider that it would be safe to reelect this man? Now remember, again, he's the guy with the nuclear codes and yet he doesn't consider nuclear war to be an existential threat. I don't know what he thinks it'll be. Is it just gonna be a walk in the park? We're talking about the skin burning off of our children, the decimation of all living things. What to speak of the nuclear winter that would follow? This doesn't seem to be a concern to President Biden, which makes me ask, what world is this man living in? He is responsible for the fact that today we are now closer to nuclear war than ever before, and he is responsible for deciding whether or not we will engage in nuclear war, and yet he doesn't consider it an existential threat. It doesn't bring me any joy to say this. I've known the Bidens. I've known President Biden. I was friend with his son Beau. We served in the National Guard. I endorsed him because I thought he had a good heart. I'm not saying this because of partisanship or hatred or anything else. I'm saying this because I love the American people and this world that we live in. I cherish peace and freedom. This world is not ours to destroy. Even if President Biden and the Democrats think that they have the right to decimate us, our families, our homes, our communities, they don't have the right to destroy all living creatures on this planet. This man does not belong in the White House holding this position of power because he's a threat to the two very most important things, life and liberty. To vote for Biden is to vote for nuclear war and tyranny, the destruction of our democracy. That is a fact."

When we build a house, we want the inside to be comfortable, even as the outside might be too hot or too cold. But we need to learn to choose our fights carefully. We have to be humble, or nature will come back to bite us. Whether you believe in chemtrails or not, the fact is that geoengineering is a real field of study, and it's a dangerous one at that. We're talking about intervening on the weather at a global scale, literally playing God, and there's no way to know for sure what will happen if we do. I mean come on we can't predict the weather two days from now as it is."

But climate change is causing an increasing number of extreme weather events that not only threaten a fun summer day, but damage our waterways, wetlands, and shorelines. Between 2012 and 2022, flooding caused six federal disasters along the Lake Superior Basin alone. impacting port towns in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. But the Biden-Harris administration's climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, is working to strengthen and secure our coastline. Because of this law, Wisconsin is set to receive nearly $1.5 million to help our underserved coastal communities prepare for and implement climate resiliency efforts so that the next flood doesn't inhibit work or play."

The colossal A76A iceberg, the largest known iceberg in the world, has broken free from its Antarctic shelf and embarked on a drifting journey towards the treacherous Drake Passage. This immense ice formation spans approximately 84 miles in length and 16 miles in width. As it traverses its path, this icy behemoth is destined to gradually melt away, posing a grave risk of elevated sea levels that could potentially lead to catastrophic flooding. A recent study has likewise brought to light the astonishing retreat of another ancient ice sheet, melting away at a mind-boggling speed of 2,000 feet every day. This revelation has offered scientists valuable insights into the potential rapid melting of ice in Antarctica and its consequences for global sea levels in our warming world."

For the next 8 to 14 days, the Climate Prediction Center is expecting a large above average confidence for warmer than normal temperatures you see this time in December. Now this is important to talk about because this area in the red just a week ago was below freezing and experiencing triple digit temperatures. What I mean by above average is temperatures that are warmer than normal and temperatures that aren't really seen this time in December. This is based on climatology over the last 30 years. Again, this is an average. I'm not saying it's never happened before, but it is unusual. You can see looking by this temperature anomaly, it's going to be very warmer than normal sitting over a portion of the central plains and Canada. This is a bigger thing for the east coast because of those temperature swings. As our climate continues to change, very large and noticeable temperature swings will begin and continue to happen. Yes, I'm talking 40s, 50s, 60s, even 70s in some places."
